files:
		may 27 - The goals at the start of the design and the resources utilized 
		pcb_prob_soulutions - keeping track of flaws and there solutions
		pds_3an - documentation of the power distribution system designed for the FPGA
		usb power design - caluculations utilized for the resistor dividers for the LTC3544

		These files were utilized in the design process here at Electronic Realization to
		facilitate a successful outcome of the open source hardware design of the USB_FPGA.
